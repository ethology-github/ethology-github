### üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @ethology-github

I'm Dr. Yong Gao, a chief scientist in Ichthyology & Ecology. My professional journey has been dedicated to understanding and conserving aquatic ecosystems, particularly in the context of hydropower development and its ecological implications.

### üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ecology and engineering principles

I'm particularly fascinated by the interdisciplinary approach that combines ecological and engineering principles. My focus is on studying degraded and manipulated aquatic ecosystems, evaluating, and mitigating anthropogenic influences on the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of riverine systems.

### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Invest

Investing in ecological integrity and ecological system services is my current pursuit. I'm exploring innovative ways to finance and support sustainable ecological practices.

### ‚ö° Fun fact:

I co-developed a balloon tag device to measure the survival rate of carps when they travel through hydropower turbines. It's one of the many innovative tools I've helped create to advance ichthyology and ecology.

### Professional Experience

- **Chief Scientist**: Leading basin-wide hydroecological investigations in Salween River, Wu River, and Jinsha River.
- **Ecological Assessments**: Assessing the effects of hydropower station constructions and their ecological conservation countermeasures.
- **Innovation**: Co-developer of the balloon tag device for carp survival rate measurements and real-time sonar tagging & sensor models for Chinese sturgeons.
- **Breeding Technique**: Co-developer of the full cycle artificial breeding technique system for Chinese sturgeon.
- **Research Team**: Leading a team of ichthyologists, ecologists, and molecular biologists to develop a germplasm bank and natural ecological recovery method for endemic and rare fish in the Yangtze River.
- **Publications**: Authored over 30 peer-reviewed journal articles.
- **Patents**: Holder of 10 patents for utility and invention.

### Professional Affiliation

- **Board Member**: Chinese Ichthyological Society; Hubei Oceanography & Limnology.
